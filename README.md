# Miva_Password

Miva_Password is a very simple library that can be used to generate and verify Miva Merchant 5 PR8-7 compatible password hashes using PHP.

> ## âš  Unmaintained Library
>
> This library was written in 2013 and then completely abandoned. The library was updated in 2024 just out of a combination of a random itch and boredom, do not take that as a sign of an active library. Nobody uses this in production.
